#Minimal APIs in .NET 8: A Simplified Approach to Build Services


#Introduction
Minimal APIs in .NET 8 make a grand entrance, redefining the way we build web services. If you’re curious about what makes Minimal APIs tick and how they can streamline your development process, let’s dive in with some engaging examples.


#The Birth Of Minimalizm in .Net 8
Think of a time when we had to write pages of code for a simple web service. Tedious, right? Minimal APIs are like a breath of fresh air. Introduced in .NET 6 and refined in .NET 8, they strip away the complexity of traditional ASP.NET Core MVC models. No more controllers, no extensive configurations — just what you need.

#why Minimal APIs
Efficiency: Write less, do more. A mantra for the modern developer.
Performance: They’re lean, mean, and fast, perfect for high-performance scenarios.
Ease of Use: New to .NET? No problem! Minimal APIs are accessible and easy to grasp.
Flexibility: Simplicity doesn’t mean limited. From microservices to large-scale applications, they’ve got you covered.
